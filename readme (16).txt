Intel Fiber Optic Connections
=============================

Caution: The fiber optic ports may utilize Class 1 or Class 1M laser
devices. Do not stare into the end of a fiber optic connector
connected to a "live" system. Do not use optical instruments to view
the laser output. Using optical instruments increases eye hazard.
Laser radiation is hazardous and may cause eye injury. To inspect a
connector, receptacle or adapter end, be sure that the fiber optic
device or system is turned off, or the fiber cable is disconnected
from the "live" system.

The Intel Gigabit and 10GbE network adapters with fiber optic
connections operate only at their native speed and only at full-
duplex. Therefore you do not need to make any adjustments. Use of
controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those
specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure. The laser
module contains no serviceable parts.
