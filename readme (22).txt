Setting Up Intel(R) 10GbE Network Connection Drivers for Microsoft* Windows* PE
*******************************************************************************

To set up network drivers for Microsoft* Windows* PE, you must import
files from the Intel(R) Network Connections software download to the
Windows PE image. Follow the directions that are appropriate for your
operating system.


32-bit Microsoft Windows PE V6
==============================

1. Create a temporary directory (for example, "c:\temp\winpe").

2. Copy all files from the "PROXGB\Win32\NDIS65\WinPE" directory to
   the temporary directory.

3. Extract the driver inf file (for example, *ixe6532.inf*) from
   "PROXGB\Win32\NDIS65\WinPE\*.zip" to the temporary directory.

4. Use the "/Add-Driver" option of the *DISM.exe* tool to import the
   drivers into the image.

   For example, use the following command:

      dism /image:C:\mounted_winpe /Add-Driver /driver:c:\temp\winpe\ixe6532.inf

   The syntax for the *dism.exe* tool is:

      dism /image:<%WINPEDIR%> /Add-Driver /driver:<path>

   Where:

   * "/image:<%WINPEDIR%>" specifies the path to the directory where
     you have mounted your Windows PE image.

   * "/Add-Driver" specifices the action dism should take.

   * "/driver:<path>" specifies the path to the driver inf file.

   Please see your Microsoft Windows PE documentation or the Microsoft
   website for more information on using *dism.exe*.


x64 Microsoft Windows PE V6
===========================

1. Create a temporary directory (for example, "c:\temp\winpe").

2. Copy all files from the "PROXGB\Winx64\NDIS65" directory to the
   temporary directory. Do NOT copy the *ixe65x64.inf* file to this
   directory.

3. Extract the driver inf file (for example, *ixe65x64.inf*)from
   "PROXGB\Winx64\NDIS62\WinPE\*.zip" to the temporary directory.

4. Use the "/Add-Driver" option of the *DISM.exe* tool to import the
   drives into the image.

   For example, use the following command:

      dism /image:C:\mounted_winpe /Add-Driver /driver:c:\temp\winpe\ixe62x64.inf

   The syntax for the *dism.exe* tool is:

      dism /image:<%WINPEDIR%> /Add-Driver /driver:<path>

   Where:

      * "/image:<%WINPEDIR%>" specifies the path to the directory
        where you have mounted your Windows PE image.

      * "/Add-Driver" specifices the action dism should take.

      * "/driver:<path>" specifies the path to the driver inf file.

   Please see your Microsoft Windows PE documentation or the Microsoft
   website for more information on using *dism.exe*.


Known Issues
============


Boot Failure in WinPE for Microsoft* Windows* 10
------------------------------------------------

Your system may fail to boot under WinPE for Microsoft Windows 10.
This can occur during a network install using IPv6. To resolve the
issue, modify the "Wait for Link" section of the INF that you insert
into the boot image. In the line:

   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete,      default,     0, "2"

Change the default, *"2"*(auto detect), to **"1"** (wait for auto
negotiation to complete). This section of your INF file should look
like the following example:

   ; Wait for Link
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete,      ParamDesc,   0, %WaitAutoNegComplete%
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete,      default,     0, "1"
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete\Enum,   "0",       0, %Off%
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete\Enum,   "1",       0, %On%
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete\Enum,   "2",       0, %AutoDetect%
   HKR, Ndi\Params\WaitAutoNegComplete,      type,        0, "enum"
